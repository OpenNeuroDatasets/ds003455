## Description
We performed a case study on a single individual to address the effects ketones on brain function, in combination with a preceeding glucose bolus. The baseline condition consisted of a standard diet supplemented 30 minutes prior to the scan with a 75g glucose bolus, a clinically standardized challenge dose for the oral glucose tolerance test. In a time-locked within-subjects design, the participant was scanned twice: on one day with a weight-dosed (395mg/kg) 25g D-Î²Hb ketone ester bolus (ses-stdbhb) and on another day without it (ses-std).  Each of these two conditions was conducted at resting-state (rest) and while performing spatial navigation (ab) and motor tasks (uni). For more details, see our article referenced below.
